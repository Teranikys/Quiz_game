# Quiz_game

A simple quiz made for study purposes.

It has 3 flags:
- a filename: determines a csv file which will be opened as a source for the quiz
- a time: determines a timelimit for the quiz
- a shuffle: determines whether the original order of questions is shuffled or not

The main topics that were learned, during developing that tiny project, are csv encoding, flags, channels and goroutines, working with files, a simple string proccesing.
